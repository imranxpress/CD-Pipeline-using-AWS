# CD-Pipeline-using-AWS


 A pipeline helps you automate steps in your software delivery process, such as initiating automatic builds and then deploying to Amazon EC2 instances. You will use AWS CodePipeline, a service that builds, tests, and deploys your code every time there is a code change, based on the release process models you define.

You will develop a continuous delivery pipeline for a small web application in this project. To store your source code, you’ll first use a version control system. 

Then you’ll learn how to set up a continuous delivery pipeline that will deploy your web application automatically anytime your source code is updated. This project uses GitHub, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline.
